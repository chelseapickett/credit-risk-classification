## Credit Risk Analysis Report

A machine learning model was used to predict healthy and high risk loan labels to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers from a dataset of historical lending activity provided by a peer-to-peer lending services company. The data was split into taining and test data sets which were used in a logistic regression model with the original data. The model was scored using the balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report imports from scikit-learn library. 

Machine Learning Model Scores:
- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision: (weighted avg) 99%           
- Recall: 99%

This machine learning model is a reliable method for predicting healthy loan and high risk loan labels based on the training data provided. The classification report shows accuracy, precision and recall scores of 99% which provide a high level of confidence in the model.
